## Description:

This Python program checks if a given year is a leap year or not. The user is prompted to input a year, and the program then checks whether it's a leap year based on the following rules:

The year is evenly divisible by 4.
If the year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400.
The program will then display a message indicating whether the input year is a leap year or not.

## Potential Improvements:

Input Validation: The program could be improved by adding error checking to ensure that the user's input is a positive integer representing a valid year.

Support for Range of Years: An additional feature could be added to allow the user to input a range of years (start year and end year) and the program could list all the leap years within that range.

Next Leap Year: The program could be enhanced to provide the next leap year if the input year is not a leap year.
